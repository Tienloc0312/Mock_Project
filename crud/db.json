    "description": "At a crowded house party in Adelaide, Cole searches for his brother Duckett. When he finds Duckett and attempts to bring him home, Duckett stabs him in the shoulder before fatally stabbing himself in the face. Some time later, 17-year-old Mia is struggling with the second anniversary of her mother Rhea's suicide by overdose and her distant relationship with her father Max. Driving at night, Mia comes across a fatally injured kangaroo, but cannot bring herself to perform a mercy kill. Mia, her best friend Jade, and Jade's little brother Riley sneak out to one of many gatherings hosted by Hayley and Joss, where the main attraction is a severed and embalmed hand of mysterious origin. Holding the hand in a handshake position and saying talk to me enables someone to communicate with a deceased person's spirit, followed by saying I let you in to allow the spirit to possess them. In order to prevent spirits from binding themselves to that person, someone else must end the possession before 90 seconds by pulling away the embalmed hand and blowing out a candle to cut the connection. Mia volunteers to go first and is possessed by a spirit that displays a menacing focus on Riley. Joss and Hayley struggle to break the connection, only managing to do so after the time limit has been slightly exceeded."
